App-Checklist-Formatter version 0.0.1

This is a program that takes a vimoutline file (.otl) with checkboxes
and processes it into an LaTeX file that may be printed out to get a
written checklist. All you further need is Vimoutliner (to facilitate
editing the checklist) and pdflatex to generate the pdf.

Producing a printable checklist is three step process:

1. Create the template and the Makefile:

   $ checklist-formatter --initialize [--filename=fname] [title of checklist]

   This creates a Makefile and a template named checklist.otl.

2. Write the checklist

   $ vim checklist.otl

   I suppose that you have vimoutline installed to facilitate the
   editing of the checklist file.

3. Process the checklist into a PDF file

   $ make

    This calls 'checklist-formatter' to generate a LaTeX file from your
    outlined checklist. The LaTeX file is then processed by pdflatex.


For further explanation of the available options use the help function
by either calling

   $ checklist-formatter --help

or

   $ checklist-formatter --man
